                    <h2 class="mt-3 mb-4">What is SEO and do I need this service?</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-4">SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization." To put it simple once your website is optimized people can see it and it can be ranked on the first pages of search engines such as Google.</p>

                    <p>Technology is fast-growing, and SEO is becoming an essential part of having a successful online presence. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy is a powerful tool for any startup and big brands. Below are six reasons to use SEO services.</p>

                    <h3 class="quote">6 reasons to use SEO services</h3>

                    <h3>Organic rank (Credibility)</h3>
                    <p>Search engine optimization enables your website to rank high on Google, which is valuable in connecting with your audience. SEO helps your website to be found and without SEO, your website cannot be found on Google or any search engines.
                      With SEO your website will organically rank high on Google, which will, in turn, amount to more clicks when found, and you, in turn, can build a target market with it.  
                      Also, organic search is an essential part of most business website performance and also a critical component of the buyer funnel and getting customers through lead generation and conversion.</p>

                      <h3>Keywords(Be found)</h3>
                      <p>Another way to use SEO to ensure maximum visibility is by using relevant keywords. Keywords are words that people regularly search on Google, and when used strategically, results in maximum visibility.
                        Keyword research is a practice all search engines use to research alternative search terms that people enter into search engines. There are also Long-tail keywords which are keywords or key phrases that are more specific and usually longer than more commonly searched for keywords. Long-tail keywords get less search traffic, but will usually have a higher conversion value, as they are more specific. For example "buy baby toys" is a <b>short-tail keyword</b> and "buy baby music learning toys" is a <b>long-tail keyword</b>. 
                        As a brand, website owner and content creator, having the right keywords on your page are relevant to having your website found on the first page of Google. Keywords are essential because they are the connection between what people are searching for and the content you are providing to fill that need. The goal in ranking on search engines is to drive organic traffic to your site from the search engine result pages (SERPs), and the keywords you choose to include in your content will determine the kind of traffic you get.
                        To create content that ranks well organically and drive visitors to your site, you need to understand the needs of those visitors – the language used and the kind of content they seek.
                        Using unique keywords should be employed on each page of your site in the areas that bots and humans normally look to reassure them that you have what they're after.
                        Singular keywords might appear to be your ultimate goal as they often have high search volume. </p>

                        <h3>SEO is a longterm startegy (Steady growth)</h3>
                       <p>The features of SEO have a positive long term effect on its visibility. Unlike <b>PPC (pay-per-click)</b> paid advertising which is a quick and an in the moment expensive investment, SEO is an investment that can last a lifetime if it's done right the first time. If you rank on the first page after your technical and on-page SEO is implemented you can stay on the first page for the long haul.  With the market evolving, it is best to follow trends and changes closely. 
Also, strategic SEO establishes a strong foundation for a website with wonderful user-experience that is easily discovered in search and also builds trust and credibility amongst its users and potential customers. So many elements go into establishing authority regarding search engines like Google. Also, authority is established over time as a result of elements such as accuracy, quality backlink profiles, positive user behavior, machine-learning signals, optimized on-page elements, and content. Authority is earned and built over time, by consistently putting out original content, thus, becoming an authority in your industry. Like they say Trust is not given its earned, and to have original and quality content with the SEO implemented you will have no problem gaining that trust. Here is an example of when I implemented SEO onto Dr.Niznick's website. Google analytics shows the growth of discoverability on search engines with in months. </p>

<h3>Local SEO (Be put on the map)</h3>
<p>Mobile traffic is increasingly growing, and as such, local search has become a fundamental part of brands. Local SEO optimizes your digital propertied for local searches so people can find you easily, putting them one step closer to a transaction. 
  It is an incredibly effective way to market your local business online, as it helps businesses promote their products and services to local customers at the exact time they're looking for them online. For example, you Google Puerto Rican food near me and it displays local restaurants.
  Local optimization focus on specific towns, cities, regions and even states, to establish a viable medium for a brand's messaging on a local level.
  SEO optimizes the brand's website and its content including local citations and backlinks, as well as, local listings relevant to the location and business sector a brand belongs to. To promote engagement on the local level, SEO optimizes a brand's knowledge graph panel, like Google my business listing and social media for starters. Below is an image exapmle if you where to google digital marketing agency near me and yu will see Tru Designs pops up as I am near my office.</p>

  <img src="images/blog/seo-local.png" alt="local seo" class="img-fluid rounded">

  <h3>Landing page (Make it happen)</h3>
 <p>A landing page is a standalone web page, created purposefully for marketing and advertising campaigns. This is where a visitor lands after they click on a link in an email or ads from search engines.
  A landing page is designed with a single focus called, call to action (CTA). It is this landing page that is the best option for increasing the conversion rates of your marketing campaigns and the cost of acquiring leads or sales. For example, you would like to collect more leads or phone calls, you create one page that has a big button or a form that does just that and it includes facts and a description of your service. So when a user types in Google's search bar "Join a soccer team" The first page of Google will display a link to that landing page for the user to sign up, accomplishing the call to action. 
  </p>

<h3> Cost-effective (Save money and make money)</h3>
<p>
  Seo is less expensive compared to other forms of online marketing such as PPC, advertising, social media marketing or buying leads from an email marketing campaign. SEO provides a good ROI, organic SEO is the backbone of your online presence, plain and simple.
</p>

<h3 class="quote">How SEO works (three types: on-page SEO, technical SEO, and off-page SEO)</h3>

<img src="images/blog/seo-types.png" alt=" seo types" class="img-fluid rounded">

<p>
  The more quality and relevant content you have on your site, the more likely search engines will be to rank your pages higher on the search engine results page. Search engines will scan, or crawl, different websites to better understand what the site and page are about.
The hidden truth to creating good content that is optimized for both the search engines and your human visitors is to create various types of content that are well researched and written on relevant topics that are relevant to your audience.
</p>

<p><b>On-Page SEO:</b>Factors are those elements that happen within your website, which goes beyond content marketing to the deeper levels of your site's HTML, it is implemented in the code for keyword research and analysis, improving the title tag and description metatag so users can see what the description is before clicking onto your link, write an effective headline, sub-headings, headings tags and image titles, because their is an image section on google users also search for, same goes for videos and shopping items.
</p>

<p>
<b>Technical SEO:</b> These are technical factors such as having an SSL so Google can securely rank your site and let users know they are in a safe environment from hacking, making sure your site is responsive to adjust to mobile screens, assuring content is not duplicated, you have an XML sitemap submitted to Google search console, adding structured data markup to your site to add locations, click to call, and important factors you would like the search engine crawler to know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Off-Page SEO:</b> These are actions taken outside of your own website to impact user perception. Amongst the sea of other brands all fighting to get to the first page, with technical and on-page, you then go to off-page SEO and get your link to be promoted to increase your rankings for being on the first page of search engines.  Examples can be creating blogs on topics that can be sharable content so you can get influencers to promote your page, or on forum submissions, social engagement of other platforms for submitting your link to rank authenticity.
